He calls the Plane of Nightmares his home. You must seek this foul creature out and acquire proof of his demise: his dark, sinister heart. Bring it to me along with your Beginner's Magic Manual.");

Back home I was a teacher of the mystic arts. and ever since arriving to this land my knowledge has increased tenfold.
