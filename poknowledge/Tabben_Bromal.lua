The racket, the noise, and the wails of the children. Bah! I came here to escape it, not to relive it. But if I survived it once, I sure as Brell's holy bottom will do it again! In hopes of getting you all out of here as soon as possible and the peace and quiet being resurrected out of your blessed absence, I've agreed to lend some of my knowledge of the more inferior levels of tinkering to those who have an interest in this art. If you don't intend on purchasing any materials, then be off with you and leave me in peace. However, if you have coin in your pocket and you plan on spending, then do so quickly. I have more pressing things to do with my time than wait while you leisurely browse my wares.");

You'll need to gather up a dense hammered casing for the outer shell; a crystalline carapace will act to protect the face of the device; and it requires a fiery power source to propel the rotor mechanism. The device is then attached around the neck, much like the one you are wearing. The only difference will be the strands of living chain that will keep it from slipping from around your neck. Place those four items and your talisman in that box and return it to me. We should be able to get this thing built for you without much fuss at all, should all things go well on your end of the task, of course.");
