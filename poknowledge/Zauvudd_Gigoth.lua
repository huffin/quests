--Beginner Combat Manual
--As a note, according to posts at Alla's (not the most reliable source I know,
--but all I've got right now) the Beginner's quests eat the Planar Traveler's Manual,
--so that quest must be completed 3 times in order to do all the Beginner's Manual
--Quests.  This is intended behaviour.
